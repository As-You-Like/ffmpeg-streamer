# ffmpeg-streamer

**ffmpeg-streamer** is a packaged nodejs [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server that wraps `ffmpeg` to allow easy streaming of video feeds directly to ***modern*** browsers for testing purposes.
It currently includes 6 different types of output streaming which are *mjpeg*, *jpeg via socket.io*, *progressive mp4*, *native hls*, [*hls.js*](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js), and *mse via socket.io*.
Video input types supported are *rtsp*, *mp4*, *mjpeg*, and *hls*.

### Installation

For command line usage on Mac or Linux, the following shows 2 options to run it.

###### Start the app from the command line
```
//linux
./ffmpeg-streamer-linux-x64

//mac
./ffmpeg-streamer-macos-x64
```

###### Or start the app from the command line via [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
```
//linux
pm2 start ffmpeg-streamer-linux-x64

//mac
pm2 start ffmpeg-streamer-macos-x64
```
After launching, you can use it via the web interface on port 8181.
For example, if your are running it on your current machine, visit it in a ***modern*** browser via [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181).
If port 8181 was already in use, it will keep incrementing the port number by 1 until it finds one available.
You can launch multiple copies of the app up to a total of 10, each listening on its own port.
If you would like to store your last used settings, go to [http://localhost:8181/activity](http://localhost:8181/activity) and click the "create" button to use the activity log.

#### Dependencies
**Ffmpeg** is the only external software required to run the app.
Nodejs is packaged inside the binary and is not need to be installed separately on your system.
When launching the app, it tries to find ffmpeg on your system using [ffbinaries](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-node).
If it cannot find ffmpeg, you will be prompted to install it to the current running directory via the web interface on port 8181.
If it does find ffmpeg, but you would like to install a newer version, you can visit [http://localhost:8181/install](http://localhost:8181/install) and force the installation.
